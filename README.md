# RASAM
RASAM is a replication-aware form of SAMOSA for mapping protein-DNA contacts in newly replicated chromatin with PacBio sequencing. In this repository, we share our code from Ostrowski, Yang et al. for detection of replication status with PacBio data from BrdU-labeled cells.

Please refer to our preprint on bioRxiv for full details on methods: [insert link here]
